## Overview üöÄ

This directory contains container entrypoint scripts that automate the setup and startup of core BSN modules.  
Each script handles initialization tasks like adding keys, configuring daemons, deploying contracts, and starting necessary background services.  
They simplify running your Babylon node environment by bundling these repetitive steps into easy-to-run scripts
