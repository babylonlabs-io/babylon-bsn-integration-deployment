## Overview üöÄ

This directory contains utility scripts for managing and interacting with Rollup BSN finality providers as well babylon Genesis FP.  
You can use them to deploy contracts, create BTC delegations, register consumers, and query provider information.  
They‚Äôre also great for testing and experimenting with the system.
